# Scientific_Computing_Project

Image classification project for the following 10 objects:
* Bicycles
* Bottles
* Chairs
* Cups/Mugs
* Forks
* Knives
* Plants
* Shoes
* Spoons
* T-Shirts

The database is created collectively by the TUBAF students of the course Scientific Computing Project. <br>
The database is 5.86 GB, which is why it cannot be included in the repository. <br>
It consists of 10 folders, one folder for each of the object that includes the images. <br>
